# Materials
## 01｜Raw materials:  

We decided to replace 3D printed plastic with wool.

 - **Key benefits**:  
 1. **Biodegradable and renewable**: Wool is a natural and renewable resource that can decompose naturally at the end of its life cycle, unlike plastic waste.  
 2. **Reduced Carbon Footprint**: Wool production is less dependent on fossil fuels compared to petroleum-derived plastics.   
 3. **Non-toxic and safe**: The process uses natural fibers that do not produce harmful fumes, making it safer to use in homes and educational settings.  
 4. **Tactile Quality**: Provides a warm, soft, and textured texture that is aesthetically pleasing and pleasant to the touch.  
 5. **Structural flexibility**: Felt objects can have a certain degree of flexibility and shock absorption, making them ideal for specific applications such as packaging and wearable devices.

## 02｜Machine model production materials:  
 1. **Needle**: multi-row needles, the core component in contact with wool. (We use toothpicks instead in the model)  
 2. **Rollers with needle foam pads** that can place materials are convenient for needle punching at more angles.
 3. **Guide rails (X-axis, Z-axis)**: we make them with rigid cardboard, and add weight with steel wire to maintain balance.
 4. Underlying **surface shell**: enclosed by cardboard.
