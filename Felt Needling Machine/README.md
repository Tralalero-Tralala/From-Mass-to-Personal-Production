## 01｜Project Description  
**Felt needeling machine** is a project we finished in **HTAM** class. We want to explore how might we reinterpret **3d modeling** using **felt** in a felt-needling machine, and how to reproduce needling using a felt-needling machine in a **fablab**.

### 1. Our inspiration
We were inspired by a brainstorming session in class. After learning and discussing the injection molding process, our group members agreed that it would be interesting to use felt instead of plastic to simulate and innovate the molding process, so we got this beautiful idea.

  <details>
    <summary>We also explore some other interesting ideas like:</summary>
    
   1. Wooden boards are used instead of acrylic materials to form shapes by superimposing them
   2. Replace traditional 3D printed printheads with printheads that can inject plastic.The shape is formed by injection molding into a 3D printed metal mold.
   3. By pressing clay and molds, the action of water allows the clay to be converted between solid and flow dynamics for reuse.

### 2. What this machine is used for?
 - Using **barbed needles** to entangle and interlock loose wool fibers into a solid form, building up shape incrementally.
 - **Biodegradable and Renewable**: Wool is a natural, renewable resource that decomposes at the end of its life, unlike persistent plastic waste.
 - **Structural Flexibility**: Felted objects can possess a degree of flexibility and shock-absorption, ideal for specific applications like packaging or wearables.

### 3. How to use this machine?
 - Step1: Put on the felt
 - Step2: Start the machine
 - Step3: Rapid Pricking
 - Step4: Get the fluffy final product

## 02｜Workflow  
### 1. Raw materials:  

We decided to replace 3D printed plastic with wool.   
<img width="472" height="434" alt="截屏2025-11-04 09 31 10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b634df-ced9-435f-9d32-f17d25e7791f" />

 - **Key benefits**:  
   - **Biodegradable and renewable**: Wool is a natural and renewable resource that can decompose naturally at the end of its life cycle, unlike plastic waste.
   - **Reduced Carbon Footprint**: Wool production is less dependent on fossil fuels compared to petroleum-derived plastics.
   - **Non-toxic and safe**: The process uses natural fibers that do not produce harmful fumes, making it safer to use in homes and educational settings.
   - **Tactile Quality**: Provides a warm, soft, and textured texture that is aesthetically pleasing and pleasant to the touch.
   - **Structural flexibility**: Felt objects can have a certain degree of flexibility and shock absorption, making them ideal for specific applications such as packaging and wearable devices.

### 2. Machine model production materials:  
 - **Needle**: multi-row needles, the core component in contact with wool. (We use toothpicks instead in the model)
 -  **Rollers with needle foam pads** that can place materials are convenient for needle punching at more angles.
 -  **Guide rails (X-axis, Z-axis)**: we make them with rigid cardboard, and add weight with steel wire to maintain balance.
 -  Underlying **surface shell**: enclosed by cardboard.
