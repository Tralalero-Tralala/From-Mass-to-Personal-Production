## 01｜Project Description  
**Felt needeling machine** is a project we finished in **HTAM** class. We want to explore how might we reinterpret **3d modeling** using **felt** in a felt-needling machine, and how to reproduce needling using a felt-needling machine in a **fablab**.

### 1. Our inspiration
We were inspired by a brainstorming session in class. After learning and discussing the injection molding process, our group members agreed that it would be interesting to use felt instead of plastic to simulate and innovate the molding process, so we got this beautiful idea.

  <details>
    <summary>We also explore some other interesting ideas like:</summary>
    
   1. Wooden boards are used instead of acrylic materials to form shapes by superimposing them
   2. Replace traditional 3D printed printheads with printheads that can inject plastic.The shape is formed by injection molding into a 3D printed metal mold.
   3. By pressing clay and molds, the action of water allows the clay to be converted between solid and flow dynamics for reuse.
   
  </details>

### 2. What this machine is used for?
 - Using **barbed needles** to entangle and interlock loose wool fibers into a solid form, building up shape incrementally.
 - **Biodegradable and Renewable**: Wool is a natural, renewable resource that decomposes at the end of its life, unlike persistent plastic waste.
 - **Structural Flexibility**: Felted objects can possess a degree of flexibility and shock-absorption, ideal for specific applications like packaging or wearables.
 - Here is our project poster⬇️:

### 3. How to use this machine?
 - Step1: Put on the felt
 - Step2: Start the machine
 - Step3: Rapid Pricking
 - Step4: Get the fluffy final product

## 02｜Workflow  
**Our workflow consists of five main parts**:  

### 1. Prototypin
### 2. Poster production
### 3. Attending Makerfaire

### 4. Getting feedback  
I think our project has a natural affection to young kids. Our users are mostly children. Maybe it's because of its colorful appearance or the eyes on it. They would just come and stand and ask :What this machine is used for?Although we write descriptions on the poster, apparently they don't understand. But still, they can guess that it is something about felt and fabric, and they would do the action of needling before I explain it to them.They were interested in it very much. Some parents told us that they had experience of doing it by hand, instead of using a machine. There's a boy come and try it for a long time. So I think maybe its a good idea if we turn it into a toy's form.  
Teacher suggested that we can add **more instruction pictures** on the poster.

### 5. Updating the open source interface

## 03｜Materials  
### 1. Raw materials:  

We decided to replace 3D printed plastic with wool.   
<img width="472" height="434" alt="截屏2025-11-04 09 31 10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b634df-ced9-435f-9d32-f17d25e7791f" />

 - **Key benefits**:  
   - **Biodegradable and renewable**: Wool is a natural and renewable resource that can decompose naturally at the end of its life cycle, unlike plastic waste.
   - **Reduced Carbon Footprint**: Wool production is less dependent on fossil fuels compared to petroleum-derived plastics.
   - **Non-toxic and safe**: The process uses natural fibers that do not produce harmful fumes, making it safer to use in homes and educational settings.
   - **Tactile Quality**: Provides a warm, soft, and textured texture that is aesthetically pleasing and pleasant to the touch.
   - **Structural flexibility**: Felt objects can have a certain degree of flexibility and shock absorption, making them ideal for specific applications such as packaging and wearable devices.

### 2. Machine model production materials:  
 - **Needle**: multi-row needles, the core component in contact with wool. (We use toothpicks instead in the model)
 -  **Rollers with needle foam pads** that can place materials are convenient for needle punching at more angles.
 -  **Guide rails (X-axis, Z-axis)**: we make them with rigid cardboard, and add weight with steel wire to maintain balance.
 -  Underlying **surface shell**: enclosed by cardboard.

## 04｜What we learned  
### 1. Learn about new crafting techniques
  The initial focus of this topic was to explore the methods and processes of making various objects around us, which allowed us to understand different production and manufacturing techniques. This expanded our understanding of craftsmanship from initially simple applications of workshops such as 3D printing and laser cutting technology to a deeper insight into many mature production processes currently achievable. **This made us realize that what we learned in the "Manufacturing Everything" course indeed has a profound connection with the manufacturing of everyday objects.**  

### 2. Benefits of brainstorming
  Before coming up with the felt machine, we went through a brainstorming session to reformulate the injection molding process. This taught us: **When it comes to change and innovation, you can think divergently from multiple angles.** For example, when reshaping a process, you can break it down into combinations of elements like materials, energy, conversion methods, scale, etc., or you can describe it using its characteristics. From there, you can start by altering these elements to conceptualize the formation of a new process. This way, **during brainstorming and continuous discussions, we can generate new ideas.**  

### 3. Transfer learning
**When thinking about the workflow of a machine, we can base it on our existing experience while also referring to the current operating methods of machines and transferring parts of the process.** Just as we did, we transferred the working method of the axes + print heads + base of a 3D printer into the felt machine, making some modifications and additions.

### 4. Gain experience through actual production
During the model-making process, we gained the following experiences:
1、 In life, we often create many "garbage" items, and these **useless things can be used to make rough models that assist us in expression.**
2、 **Only imagining a model in the mind often differs from reality.** When making a needle, we found it was always unbalanced and difficult to stand upright on the axis as we imagined. Fortunately, there were many other materials available, and we eventually repaired it into a balanced model. So, **when making models, it's necessary to consider potential unexpected issues and be prepared.**  

### 5. Engage with real users to get feedback
At the maker faire, models and posters were displayed. We found that wool materials and simple machine models were very popular with children, and they were very willing to understand and experience how the needle-punching wool works. Many parents also expressed that they had never thought such a craft could become a machine. From this, we can imagine future directions, such as further refining the machine's working structure, realizing the machine, and even adding safety protections to create child-friendly or workshop versions.  

### 6. Reflection on poster production
Regarding poster production, we have the following reflections: At the maker faire, children barely understood the posters, and adults could only guess the machine's purpose and working method. Therefore, the problem might lie in the posters. **When creating an explanatory poster, it is necessary to express the machine's materials, working method, and results using easy-to-understand and vivid images.**


## 05｜Next steps
If we were given another month or more, we would: **Turn the grass mold into a functioning machine**.   

### Short term plan
 1. **Transform the "shape" of the sketch mold into executable drawings**  
 - Parametric measurement: accurately measure the dimensions of all structures (length, width and height of the frame, the movement trajectory and distance of the guide rail, the position of the motor, etc.)
 - Use CAD software or other drawing software to draw two-dimensional drawings
 - Make the connection relationship of each component  
 2. **Analyze the logic of movement**
How each axis and roller moves, utilizing the Arduino   
 3. **Material iteration**
The structure of the grass mold is reconstructed with strong materials.  
 - Replace the cardboard with multi-layer wooden boards or acrylic boards. These materials are easy to process with laser cutting or simple tools, providing sufficient rigidity.  
 - Motion system: introduce standard parts. Connection: Screws, nuts, and corner codes are used across the board instead of glue, ensuring a stable and adjustable structure.  
 4. **Core function: acupuncture**
 - Make a reliable gripper with 3D printing or metal parts to ensure that the needle does not loosen or deflect during high-speed up and down movements.
 - Calibrate the Piercing Depth: Through software and limit switches, precisely control the depth of the needle tip into the wool.  
 5. **Make the machine easy to use, durable, like a real product**
 - **Improve user experience**: Develop a simple UI: Create a simple web or desktop interface that allows users to directly upload images and click to start without touching complex code.  
 - **Automate Processes**: Write scripts to automate the process from images to code to starting needle punching.  
 - **Safety and appearance**: Add protective covers: Use acrylic sheets or grids to add protective shields to moving parts to prevent users from accidentally touching high-speed moving needles and belts.

### Long term plan
**Version iteration 2**: Improve the material again to make it more suitable for mass procedural production
